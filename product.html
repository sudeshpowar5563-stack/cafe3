                        The modern burger evolved from "Hamburg steak," a dish brought to America by German immigrants,
                        with different individuals and locations claiming to have created the first hamburger sandwich
                        around the late 19th century.

                        Cadbury was founded in 1824 in Birmingham, England, by John Cadbury (1801–1889), a Quaker who
                        sold tea, coffee and drinking chocolate. Cadbury developed the business with his brother
                        Benjamin, followed by his sons Richard and George.

                        The history of hot coffee begins with its discovery in Ethiopia, where its stimulant properties
                        were first noted, leading to its spread to Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula around the 15th
                        century. Arabs were the first to roast and brew the beans with hot water, and coffeehouses
                        became social centers in the 16th century. The beverage eventually reached Europe in the 17th
                        century, with its cultivation expanding to colonies in India, Indonesia, and the Americas,
                        eventually becoming a globally popular drink

                            The term "Mirch-masala-pizza" can refer to a dish offered by the Mirch Masala restaurant
                            chain or a concept of Indian-spiced pizza. The restaurant chain, founded in 1992 by Rushad
                            Ginwala, was inspired by Punjab's roadside 'dhaba' restaurants and has since expanded
                            internationally, with its "Mirch Masala" brand offering a fusion of Indian flavors.
                            Separately, other restaurants, such as Mirchi Cafe in Dublin, California, also offer dishes
                            with similar names, like a "Mirch Masala Pizza," which features a blend of spices and halal
                            meats.
